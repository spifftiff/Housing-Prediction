# Housing-Prediction
Predicting home prices- school project

A machine learning pipeline to predict housing prices based on key features such as median income, house age, location, and proximity to amenities. Leveraged regression models to provide accurate predictions and gain insights into how different features influence house prices. The project includes:

    -Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
    -Feature Engineering: Created new features to enhance model performance.
    -Model Selection: Compared multiple regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting, to find the best-performing model.
    -Visualization: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore data trends and showcase model results.
    -Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebooks.
